### inspiration
- research is a good way to group knowledge of different types
- projects in `nchrs` contains stuff from audio+visual in `xxiivv`
- about has everything about the author (bio, social, beliefs, goals, values)
  - has meta which contains the index, journal and details about the site builder markup
  - directory is great for showcasing stuff i'm using like tools i didn't build and hardware inventory, and books/movies/music/bookmarks. this can be placed in about

### nanaadane
for stuff in `knowledge` and `project`; if the list grows longer than 5 group related items.

- knowledge (stuff i'm learning)
