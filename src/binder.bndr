In an attempt to get over a case of [coder's blog|https://twitter.com/NanaOAdane/status/1484731437265920004?s=20], I built myself a static generator. It's called *binder*. _It's what generated what you're reading now._

It was inpired by stuff others have built like [oscean|https://github.com/XXIIVV/oscean] is used to generate [the XXIIVV wiki|https://wiki.xxiivv.com] and a similar [tool|https:github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co] used to generate the [Hundredrabbits' site|http://100r.co]. It aims to be a [memex|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex] (memory extension) or wiki generator as the former example is.

It is something I had wanted to build for a while now. It was really fun building out a parser for a markup language, inspired to markdown, called `bndr`. The language spec can be [found here|https://github.com/v3rse/binder#bndr-markup]

I look forward to write a lot more using this tool while also refining its functionality over time. It has replaced the use of [hexo|https://hexo.io/] on this site and is aimed at being very simple.

You can find *binder* [here|https://github.com/v3rse/binder]

_Disclaimer: it's not fit for human consumption. don't use it!_

*Happy Coding*
