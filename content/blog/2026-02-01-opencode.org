* Setup Gemini when you have Google AI Plus/Ultra subscription
Note: you don't get Gemini API keys with your Google AI subscription but you do get more usage credits when you use Gemini CLI and Antigravity.

But you use this OpenCode plugin to use you subscription: [[https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth][jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth: Gemini auth plugin for opencode]]

* Setup Docker MCP
[[https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/get-started/#opencode][Verify MCP - OpenCode]]
use ~opencode run ...~ instead of the command use in the instructions

* Ollama Support
Seems like you can setup OpenCode to use Ollama:
[[https://docs.ollama.com/integrations/opencode][OpenCode - Ollama]]

Simple as ~ollama launch opencode~ and then you pick the models you want.
You may need to increase the ollama context window size since OpenCode needs that:
[[https://docs.ollama.com/context-length][Context length - Ollama]]
This can be added to [[/usr/lib/systemd/system/ollama.service][/usr/lib/systemd/system/ollama.service]] as an ~Environment~ entry
You'll need to run ~systemctl daemon-reload~ to apply the changes
