Dwarf Fortress is game with old looking ASCII graphics, procedurally generated worlds, characters and lore. What's not to love about it.

* Changing the tileset

The original tileset hurts my eyes so I switched to [[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic~145362.0][Wanderlust]]

Steps:
1. Download the archive.
2. Unzip.
3. Overwrite ~data~ and ~raw~ in ~~/.dwarffortress~ with the downloaded ones.

** Hot Keys

Most keys are shown on the sidebar but it's good to call them out here.

- ~tab~ to change the screen layout
- ~mouse wheel scroll~ to zoom layout in and out
- ~space~ to pause and resume
- ~k~ to use arrow keys to look around
- ~arrow keys~ move cursor
- ~<~ move up one layer up and ~>~ move down one layer. *dwarf fortress is a 2D representation of 3D game*
- ~F1~ center on embark point
- ~d~ desgination i.e. pick job to do
- ~enter~ to start selection of area of designaion and enter again to close selection
- ~-/+~ navigating between links
- ~~~ DFHack if you have it installed
