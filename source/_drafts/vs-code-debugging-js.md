title: VSCode Debugging - JS Edition

This is another talk I gave to expose the debugging features in VSCode to my team. Context is the most useful thing when debugging. Most beginners start by using a `console.log()` to find out contents of variables at run time.

Using a debugger takes us a step further by helping you quickly get the big picture view of your code at runtime (call stacks, variables etc.) so you don't have to play computer in your head.

The slides still need a bit of fleshing out mainly because I did a lot of demos that day. More information can be found below:
