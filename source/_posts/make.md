So I got really bored, listened to a [podcast](https://megamaker.simplecast.fm/episodes/24177-life-is-better-when-you-make-stuff) and signed up for the [maker challenge](http://megamaker.co/challenge/). Basically I've taken   up [@mijustin's](https://twitter.com/mijustin) challenge of making a hundred things this year!! Check out stuff he's making [here](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/4zuxk966ka7u993l/x1e516/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vYS9iaXpib3guY2EvZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xNmdWb25YRGpkdmxqNnlCUC1oT21ia3R1Z1ozLVFrTE93X25oUk45eGxVcy9lZGl0P3VzcD1zaGFyaW5n).

Here I am thinking :

>"What the hell am I going to make(that's worth anyone's time)?"

Plus I'm totally freaking out. Then I remember all that Justin (the aforementioned guy) wrote in his [Maker's Manifesto](http://megamaker.co/manifesto/) (which is also on his list) and think

>"Why shouldn't I?"

__I could make anything I want!! Forget what people think__

A story
---

I love stories. From history books to biographies and even documentaries. But you know what's cooler than reading or listening to a story?

__Making one up!!__

Star Wars...made up, LOTR...made up. Truth is in real life we MAKE up our story as we live it. As we do things....as we make things.
In this [podcast](https://megamaker.simplecast.fm/episodes/24363-what-s-really-driving-me) Justin quoted  _Micheal Jamin's_ definition of a story:

>"A story tells the struggle of a hero fighting an obstacle to achieve a goal"

So who's the __hero__ in my story?


__ME!!__

This scares the life out of me.

What's the __obstacle__?

__ME!!__

My fears and my procrastination. Any external obstacle seems to be something I allow.

What's the __goal__?

__Total World Domination__

No not really. All a maker or an artist seeks is to communicate what is in their hearts to the world around them and to know that their message was heard.

So I'll tell my story here. I'll share what I dream about and the tiny ideas that give me sleepless nights.


A 100 things

Well I can't think of a hundred things immediately but I think can build that list by putting up 10 ideas each month. So watch this space and you can suggest some ideas I could work on in the comments section. Better still you can join the [challenge](http://megamaker.co/challenge/).
