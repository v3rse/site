Keeping it Open Yo!
-------------------
This is a presentation I shared during an open source initiative session at work (Dreamoval Limited). I chose to contribute to [Yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) (Yeoman CLI). Awesome right! I made this choice because I wanted to get into the core of the Node.js community.There's not much in the slide but do enjoy it.
