Everyone has heroes. Apart from Jesus I just discovered another one of mine.

## TLDR: Christ is Steph Curry's ID and mine as well

### A bit of a primer

For those who don't know him too well Steph Curry's pretty much the best 3 point shooter in the NBA  and playing with one of the hardest working teams in the NBA right now, __IMHO__, the Golden State Warriors.

It wasn't always like that for him though. Although he came from a family of highly athletic people (NBA player Dell Curry who was also a great shooter, a mom who played college volleyball and younger siblings who are excelling in their own sports careers), he was rejected by the some of the top college teams after high school because they thought his small frame wasn't what they wanted in a star point guard(sound familiar? Hint: David).

After a being picked up by a then unknown liberal arts college named Davidson (There is that name again...don't wanna be superstitious here though) he had a bit of a slow start. However, soon in his college career he would lead the nation in scoring second only to Kevin Durant.

He got picked by the Warriors in 2009 and if things hadn't been rough enough he started his career off with two ankle surgeries between 2011 and 2012.

Finally, in 2015 he rose to super stardom when he led his team to their first NBA championship  since __1975!!__

But enough of the history lesson. If you want to know more about his current exploits and history just [Google|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry] his name or watch the video below by ESPN:

## Let's break it down

Now I know some of you are saying "..well he's just a basketball player". Just bear with me a little longer.

Here are a few things I noted from his life:

* He works his butt off to everyday to be the best he can humanly be.
{% youtube S7cZKAz6Meo %}
* He considers himself __blessed__ to be a Christian instead of being ashamed of it (especially in a place like the US ...on stage like that!!)
* He honors his parents and thinks "family" in all he does. He and his brother Seth even wear the same number as their dad did to honor him (__# 30__)
{% youtube -INfAb3Aggk %}
* He honors his heavenly father in all he does. Knowing that he's looked up to by many people, he lives a life that always points back __UP__ to Jesus.

After all the __hard work, honor, humility__ and __heart__, I see someone who held on to __faith__ and gained __hope__ in dark times. He keeps this __faith__ even now and  I believe it's the source of his confidence in-game. This __hope__ manifests itself in his ability to rally his team in a tough match and keep it together when things get intense.


## What does all this even mean

I love basketball and I love Steph Curry but really the greatest effect he's had on me is to make me question my identity in Christ.

I asked myself whether I was really laying it all out there for the one who has bought me with his own blood. Growing up I've always wanted to be like someone I saw on TV, someone I had read of in a book or met in life that inspired me. These people aren't necessarily bad but I came to depend on these different role models for my identity as a person.

Failing to achieve the same status as they did brought me crashing down into an existential crisis because I ate up their ideologies and didn't focus on _the race that already had been marked out for me._

Letting go of all that gives me a fresh start. I had read many biographies (as I have in this case) but I never thought of life as having a story of my own to tell about  Christ living in me as Steph has done and is doing.

>1 Corinthians 10:31-11:1

>_31 So then, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of [our great] God. 32 Do not offend Jews or Greeks or even the church of God [but live to honor Him]; 33 just as I please everyone in all things [as much as possible adapting myself to the interests of others], not seeking my own benefit but that of the many, so that they [will be open to the message of salvation and] may be saved._

>_11:1 Imitate me, just as I imitate Christ._

I live a life that must be satisfied by Christ alone. My identity is in Christ no where else and because I'm satisfied by Him:

>Philipians 4:13

>_13 __I can do all things__ [which He has called me to do] through Him who strengthens and empowers me [to fulfill His purpose—I am self-sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency; I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him who infuses me with inner strength and confident peace.]_


If you haven't chosen Jesus yet now is the time. Give me holla in the comments and I'll point you in the right direction. Looking forward to comments on these thoughts as well(posted this raw so ...lot's of mistakes).

To my brother Steph I'll be praying for you man...keep that finger pointing __UP__!!
