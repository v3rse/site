This is a talk I gave at work (Kudobuzz) on using Vim as your primary text editor. I was basically trying to convert as many of my colleagues into Vim users as I could (none of that `M-a C-x` stuff).

It outlines the different levels of Vim mastery and how progress. It draws heavily from the following blog posts:

- [A vim Tutorial and Primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim)
- [Learn Vim Progressively](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/)


__Happy Coding__
